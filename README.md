### Golden Gate Issues

This is a sample application to use react&redux.



#### To install dependencies, in root directory, run:

```
npm install
```

#### To run tests:
```
npm test
```


#### To build the package and start dev server:
```
npm start
```

This will run `webpack-dev-server` and start serving the application on [http://127.0.0.1:8080/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/)

**Notes:**
History fallback feature of the development server(webpack-dev-server) doesn't work as expected. So, if you want to do a refresh for some reason(eg. unhandled expection) please first go to root `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`, then, do the refresh so the application can restart.

**Built using:**
- react
- react-router
- redux
- webpack
- ...

Thanks.
